# ASP.NET CRUD v1.0

This is the first CRUD demo Module with four fields!

The first one is a TextBox which accepts Patient Name.<br>
The second is RadioButtons within ButtonGroup which is used to determine Patient's Gender.<br>
The third is a DropdownList which determines Patient's Covid Status!<br>
The fourth and last is a CheckBox which decides whether a vaccine is available for Covid Positive Patients

# Known Bugs

1. If you try to update some female then male, the radio button still remains on female only
2. If someone was covid positive with vaccine available, and you decide to update another person with covid negative, the CheckBox gets disabled and remains Checked!
